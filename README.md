# ゴールデンボンバー – 酔わせてモヒート

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
The truth is that I want to push you down and
Fulfill all my desires
But while wondering "Will you hate me for that?"
I am shaking from bewilderment

What's the right decision?
I don't know whether I will be yours
These thoughts that I am pointlessly overthinking are
Analyzing this relationship

In any case you are beautiful
And I am just a freeter This restaurant I made a reservation at is out of my league
I can't read the menu

I can't show you the real me
My heart will scatter eventually
The worlds in which we live are too different This is a fruitless effort
I pretend to be familiar with alcohol
The mojito I ordered casually
The taste of mint that I hate so much
This love seems to be so bitter

I get dizzy from being too nervous
Or did I get drunk from you, I wonder
Is the world right now the sequel to the previous riddle?
Ah our conversation already came to a halt

I burn up when our eyes meet
No matter how many times I look at you, you're so cute
In the mirror in the restroom I'm looking at
My sorry face, I've gotten drunk

We're in a world where everything is possible, but
This love, will it turn out well?
You will hardly gain anything from it I wonder if you're sad
Your reaction is not complete
Worrying too much it will hardly be good
How? Why? Is it a lie?
What will become of this love?

The distance gets smaller Our fingers that touched
Your cheeks that come closer Your sweet cologne
How far will we go?
Calm down and Don't be impatient It's just my instinct

Will it be ok to show the real me?
This attitude of you who doesn't reject me
However, well, but, no way...
I don't understand
I pretend to be familiar with alcohol
The mojito that I regret having ordered
The bitterly strong taste of mint
It makes me even drunker

The truth is that I want to push you down and
Fulfill all my desires
But while wondering "Will you hate me for that?"
I am shaking from bewilderment
